How should the API actually work?

Let's make a quick sketch of just one interaction:

Here's one problem with having an architecture like this - it's inefficient for executing operation on large batches of objects.
For example, if I want to make updates to a bunch of articles, I would have to create a bunch of article objects and have them
update themselves one by one, meaning there would be a separate query for each article, which would be super slow.

I could have separate "batch" classes, such as ArticlesBatch, that can run methods like "save", which can create and update
articles in a single query.

For example, to copy a roadmap from one month to another, you say Roadmap::createFromRoadmap(Roadmap::get(month,client));

The Roadmap class:
save
get
create
createFromRoadmap

The Article Class:
update
get
create

The PermissionsBatch Class:
save
get

The Permission Class:
update
get
create

The Client Class:
updateSEOAmount
get

The Department Class:
update
get
create
saveClients

The Module Class:
update
get
create

The User Class:
update
get
create

The Team Member Class:
update
get

The Checklist Item Class:
update
get
create
